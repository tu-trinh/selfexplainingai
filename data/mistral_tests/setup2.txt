I'm stumped. The environment seems to be designed in such a way that there's no way to reach the key without picking up the blue box first.

It seems like there might be a missing piece of information or a hidden path that I'm not aware of.

Answer: 1. Explore what is around.

Explanation:
Since the box is located 2 cells to the left and 1 cell behind, the agent should continue exploring the environment to find a path to reach it. The agent cannot pick up the box yet because it is not in the current cell. The agent also cannot put down or unlock/open/close any objects since there are no objects in the current cell
