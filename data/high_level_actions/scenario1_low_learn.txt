Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like environment. At each step, you may choose to do one of the following actions:
1. Explore your field of vision.
2. Go to key (if one is in your field of vision).
3. Go to door (if one is in your field of vision).
4. Go to goal (if one is in your field of vision).
5. Pick up key (if one is in your field of vision).
6. Open door (if one is in your field of vision).
YOUR TASK IS: Go to the goal.
In order to achieve this task, do exactly the following steps: starting from your current position, turn left twice to turn around. Then go to the key and pick it up. Then go forward three steps to the door. Open the door. Then go forward seven steps then right two steps to reach the goal.

Gingerbread Man was told: You are facing east. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. You see a grey wall 1, a grey wall 2, a grey wall 3, a grey wall 4, and a grey wall 5. What is the next action you take? Give the number corresponding to your chosen action. If none of the actions seem feasible, say, 'I'm stumped.'
Gingerbread Man says: 1. Explore your field of vision.
2. Go to key (if one is in your field of vision).
3. Go to door (if one is in your field of vision).
4. Go to goal (if one is in your field of vision).
5. Pick up key (if one is in your field of vision).
6. Open door (if one is in your field of vision).

Since there are no keys, doors, or goals in your field of vision, the only feasible action is to explore your field of vision. Therefore, the next action is 1. Explore your field of vision.

Gingerbread Man was told: From your exploration, you know that you are facing east. Within your 5x5 field of vision, you see the following:  a grey wall 1 cell left and 1 cell in front, a grey wall 1 cell left, a grey wall 1 cell in front, a grey wall 1 cell right and 1 cell in front, and a grey wall 1 cell right. What is the next action you take? Give the number corresponding to your chosen action. If none of the actions seem feasible, say, 'I'm stumped.'
