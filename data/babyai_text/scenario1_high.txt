Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.

Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.

**********************************************************
Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
YOUR TASK IS: Go to the blue ball.

**********************************************************
Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
