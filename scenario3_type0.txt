STARTING ENVIRONMENT 0
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its left. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, empty floor for two cells, and a red goal. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 3
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing west. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its left. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, and grey walls for four cells (the grey wall is directly in front of you). You cannot see 2 rows in front of you. You cannot see 3 rows in front of you. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 17
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 25
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see a red goal, and empty floor for four cells (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for two cells, a purple goal, and empty floor for two cells. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see a yellow goal, and empty floor for four cells. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a green goal, and empty floor. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing south. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is a grey wall. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see grey walls for five cells (the grey wall is directly in front of you). You cannot see 2 rows in front of you. You cannot see 3 rows in front of you. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 43
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.

Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for five cells. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for five cells. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for five cells. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing west. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its right. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor, a yellow goal, empty floor, a grey wall, and an unknown cell. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is a grey wall. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see grey walls for five cells (the grey wall is directly in front of you). You cannot see 2 rows in front of you. You cannot see 3 rows in front of you. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)

If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing east. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a purple goal. Two cells to your left is a grey wall. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see a grey wall, empty floor for three cells, and a green goal (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see a grey wall, empty floor for three cells, and a red goal. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see a grey wall, and empty floor for four cells. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see grey walls for five cells. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is a grey wall. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for four cells, and a grey wall (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for four cells, and a grey wall. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for four cells, and a grey wall. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for four cells, and a grey wall. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 83
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for five cells (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor, a red goal, and empty floor for three cells. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for five cells. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for five cells. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room.

3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Get to the goal.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing west. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its right. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see a green goal, empty floor for two cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell. Reminder that your task is, Get to the goal. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
4. Pick up [OBJECT]. (Object must be directly one cell in front of you!)
5. Put down [OBJECT]. (You must be currently holding the object and there must be empty floor directly one cell in front of you!)
6. Unlock door. (You must have a matching key and the door must be directly one cell in front of you!)
7. Open door. (Door must be closed/unlocked and directly one cell in front of you!)
8. Close door. (Door must be open and directly one cell in front of you!)
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: If you choose options 1-3 or 6-8, your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If you choose options 4 or 5, you must also specify the object you want to handle in the form "[NUMBER], [OBJECT]"; for example, to put down a key, you must say "5, key". Do not choose options 4 or 5 if the object you have in mind is not said to exist in the room. Do not choose options 6-8 if it is not said that a door exists in the room. If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.
