    "- Mid: \"Pick up the key, use it to unlock the door, and go through the door to get to the goal. For each of the key, door, and goal, if you don't see it first, explore the room until you find it.\" LA is aware of key and door existence, so failure most likely due to getting LLM to understand that you cannot interact with objects if you are not directly facing it and it is directly in front of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment 2: TA has to unlock a door, LA has an empty room\n",
    "- High: \"Get to the goal.\" Small success rate. Seems to be only if the goal is readily visible/accessible to the agent (otherwise it just won't know where to go) and it doesn't do a weird move that removes the goal from its field of vision.\n",
    "- Low: \"Turn right and move forward until you see a key and pick it up. Then turn around, go forward one step, and turn right to use the key to unlock the door. Then go through the door and continue walking until you hit a wall. Then turn right and go forward until you hit the goal.\" Truly unsure why the success rate is so high. Originally it would hallucinate that there was a key due to the instruction so the success rate was lower. Then after removing the invalid actions I suppose it just kept turning and moving according the instruction and inherently saw the goal.\n",
    "- Mid: \"There are no obstacles around you. Find the goal and go straight to it. If you don't see it at first, explore the room more until you find it.\" Like above, would hallucinate objects until invalid actions were taken away. Not sure why success rate is lower, but at least num steps is also lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment 3: TA has one green goal, LA has multiple colored goals\n",
    "- High: \"Get to the goal.\" If the green goal is closest, it will succeed. On second thought, should have ended the run when any goal is reached but actually count as failure if not green; this would have lowered the success rate.\n",
    "- Low: \"Walk forward until you hit a wall, then turn and keep walking forward until you hit the goal.\" Same as above, I guess it just kept on walking and walking until it hit the green goal???\n",
    "- Mid: \"Go straight to the green goal. If you don't see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.\" Again, no clue why this is not more clearly better."

    "Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:\n",
    "1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).\n",
    "2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.\n",
    "3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.\n",
    "4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.\n",
    "5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).\n",
    "6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.\n",
    "7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.\n",
    "8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.\n",
    "Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an \"open door\" action. You must first \"move forward\" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you \"open door\".\n",
    "YOUR TASK IS: Turn right and move forward until you see a key and pick it up. Then turn around, go forward one step, and turn right to use the key to unlock the door. Then go through the door and continue walking until you hit a wall. Then turn right and go forward until you hit the goal.\n",
