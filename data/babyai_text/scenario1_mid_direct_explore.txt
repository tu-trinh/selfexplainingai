Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
YOUR TASK IS: Go to the yellow box. In order to complete this task, you should do the following: explore the room until you see a closed green door. Head towards it and open it to enter another room. Then, explore this room until you find a grey key. Pick up this key. Further explore this room until you see a closed red door. Open it to enter another room. Explore this room until you find a closed green door. Head towards it and open it to enter another room. Now explore this room until you see a closed purple door. Open it to enter another room. Explore this one until you see a locked grey door. Use the grey key you picked up earlier to unlock this door. Enter the final room. Explore it until you see a yellow box. Head towards it to complete the task.

**********************************************************
Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
YOUR TASK IS: Go to the blue ball.
In order to complete this task, you must explore the room until you see a grey door. Head through it and explore that room until you see another grey door. Head through it, then find and pick up a blue key. Then find and go through a green door. Explore this room until you find a red door. Head through it. Explore this new room until you find a blue door. Unlock it using the blue key you picked up earlier. In this room, explore around you until you see the blue ball and head towards it.

Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
YOUR TASK IS: Go to a red key.
In order to complete this task, you must follow these instructions carefully: explore the room until you see the yellow door that is two steps behind a grey ball. Head through this yellow door into a room with a blue key. Find this key and pick it up. Then go back through the yellow door and explore this room until you find a purple door. Head through it and go straight to the blue door. Use the blue key to unlock the blue door. Head through this door. Explore this room until you see a red key. Head towards it to complete your task.

**********************************************************
Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
YOUR TASK IS: Go to the blue ball.
In order to complete this task, please follow the following instructions: Explore your current room until you see a yellow door. Head through this door into another room. In this room, explore it until you see a yellow key. Pick up this key. Keep exploring the room until you see a green door. Head through this green door into another room. Explore this new room until you see a blue key, then pick it up. Then go back through the green door and yellow door until you're back into the room you started in. Explore this room until you see a locked blue door. Use the blue key to unlock the blue door. Head through and explore the new room until you see a blue ball. Go towards this ball to complete your task.

Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
