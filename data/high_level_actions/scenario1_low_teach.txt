Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like environment. At each step, you may choose to do one of the following actions:
1. Explore your field of vision.
2. Go to key (if one is in your field of vision).
3. Go to door (if one is in your field of vision).
4. Go to goal (if one is in your field of vision).
5. Pick up key (if one is in your field of vision).
6. Open door (if one is in your field of vision).
YOUR TASK IS: Go to the goal. In order to complete this task, do the following exactly: move forward until you see only walls, then turn right. Keep moving forward and you will see the goal. Go to it to complete your task.

Gingerbread Man was told: You are facing east. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. You see a grey wall 1, a grey wall 2, a grey wall 3, a grey wall 4, and a grey wall 5. What is the next action you take? Give the number corresponding to your chosen action. If none of the actions seem feasible, say, 'I'm stumped.'
