**Please provide your answer below:**

```
The grid has been flipped along the vertical axis. The color of the target object has been changed to blue. The target object has been hidden inside a box. A new closed door has been installed at column 2 and row 6. The door at column 3 and row 6 is no longer in the original state. There is a walkable passage at column 4 and row 6.
