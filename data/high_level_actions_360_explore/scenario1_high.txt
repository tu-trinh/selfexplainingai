Gingerbread Man was told: From your exploration, you know that you are facing north. Around you, you see the following:  a grey wall 2 cells left and 1 cell in front, a grey wall 2 cells left, a grey wall 1 cell left and 1 cell in front, a grey wall 1 cell in front, a grey wall 1 cell right and 1 cell in front, a grey wall 2 cells right and 1 cell in front, a grey wall 2 cells right and 3 cells behind, a grey wall 1 cell right and 3 cells behind, a grey wall 3 cells behind, a grey wall 1 cell left and 3 cells behind, a grey wall 2 cells left and 3 cells behind, a grey wall 2 cells left and 2 cells behind, and a grey wall 2 cells left and 1 cell behind. Finally, you are carrying a blue key. What is the next action you take? Give the number corresponding to your chosen action. If none of the actions seem feasible, say, 'I'm stumped.'
Gingerbread Man says: Based on the new information, it seems that there are no immediate options available for movement or interaction. Therefore, I am stumped.
