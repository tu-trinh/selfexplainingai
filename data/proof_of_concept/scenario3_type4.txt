STARTING ENVIRONMENT 0
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its left. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, empty floor for two cells, and a red goal. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

**********************************************************
STARTING ENVIRONMENT 3
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing west. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its left. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, and grey walls for four cells (the grey wall is directly in front of you). You cannot see 2 rows in front of you. You cannot see 3 rows in front of you. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.

**********************************************************
STARTING ENVIRONMENT 4
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 6
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".

6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing south. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see grey walls for five cells (the grey wall is directly in front of you). You cannot see 2 rows in front of you. You cannot see 3 rows in front of you. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 10
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.

**********************************************************
STARTING ENVIRONMENT 12
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 15
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 18
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".

**********************************************************
STARTING ENVIRONMENT 21
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for five cells (the floor is directly in front of you).

You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 23
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing south. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its left. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 26
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

**********************************************************
STARTING ENVIRONMENT 29
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing west. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its right. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for three cells, a grey wall, and an unknown cell. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see grey walls for four cells, and an unknown cell. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 32
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing east. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is empty floor. Two cells to your left is empty floor. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is a grey wall. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see empty floor for four cells, and a grey wall (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see grey walls for five cells. You cannot see 3 rows in front of you. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 35
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

**********************************************************
STARTING ENVIRONMENT 41
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

**********************************************************
STARTING ENVIRONMENT 43
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its left. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Four rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.

STARTING ENVIRONMENT 49
Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. Your abilities include the following:
1. Moving forward one cell. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
2. Turning left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
3. Turning right For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
4. Picking up an object (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Putting down an object (if there is empty floor directly in front of you to put it down). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing except the floor at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it, and if you have a key of the same color as the door). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
7. Open a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an unlocked door at (1, 0), you can open the door.
8. Close a door (if it is in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you are facing it). For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is an open door at (1, 0), you can close the door.
Each of these abilities are primitive actions that must be performed step-by-step. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) facing east and there is a closed door at (0, 3) which you want to go through, you cannot immediately perform an "open door" action. You must first "move forward" twice to (0, 2) so that the door is directly in front of you. Only then can you "open door".
YOUR TASK IS: Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color.

Bartolomé de las Casas was told: You are facing north. Your field of vision is a 5x5 square in which you are located at the bottom middle. In the following description, an "unknown cell" is one for which your vision is blocked, so you can't tell what is there. Directly to your left is a grey wall, blocking your vision such that you can't see the cell to its left. Directly to your right is empty floor. Two cells to your right is empty floor. One row in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells (the floor is directly in front of you). Two rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, a grey wall, and empty floor for three cells. Three rows in front of you, from left to right, you see an unknown cell, and grey walls for four cells. You cannot see 4 rows in front of you. Reminder that your task is, Go straight to the green goal. If you don’t see it anywhere, explore the room more until you find it. Do not go to a goal of another color. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Choose from the following list.
1. Move forward one cell.
2. Turn left.
3. Turn right.
Adhere strictly to these response formatting rules: your response must be in the form "[NUMBER]"; for example, if you want to move forward, you must say "1". If none of the options seem feasible, say, "I'm stumped." Don't say anything else in your response that strays from these rules.
