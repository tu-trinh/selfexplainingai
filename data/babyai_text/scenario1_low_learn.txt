Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
YOUR TASK IS: Go to the red key. Here's how you can do it: Move forward three steps. Turn left. Move forward five steps. Open the blue door. Move forward five steps, going through the blue door. Turn left to reach the red key.

Gingerbread Man was told: You see a wall 1 step right. You see a grey key 1 step left. You see a red key 4 steps forward. What is the next action you take in order to complete your given task? Please tell me the number corresponding to your chosen action. If you choose 4 (pick up) or 5 (drop), please also tell me the object you'll be interacting with. If none of the actions seem feasible, say, 'I'm stumped.'
Gingerbread Man says: I will choose action 4 to pick up the red key.

Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door.

**********************************************************
Gingerbread Man was told: You are an agent who is trying to complete a task in an unknown, grid-like room. At each step, you may choose to execute one of the following actions:
1. Turn left. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning left would have you in the same cell but facing west.
2. Turn right. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, turning right would have you in the same cell but facing east.
3. Move forward. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing north, moving forward would put you in (0, 1).
4. Pick up an object. The object must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0) and facing east, and there is a ball at (1, 0), you can pick up the ball and will be able to travel with it until you put it down.
5. Drop an object. There must be space directly in front of you to drop it. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a key, and there is nothing at (0, 1), you can put the key down on (0, 1).
6. Unlock, open, or close a door. The door must be in a cell cardinally adjacent to you and you must be directly facing it. If it is locked, you must be holding a key of the same color as the door. For example, if you are in cell (0, 0), facing north, and holding a green key, and there is a green door at (0, 1), you can use the key to unlock the door, after which the door will also open.
YOUR TASK IS: Go to a purple box. Ignoring what you see around you and just following these steps exactly will help you achieve this task: Start from your current position. Turn right twice. Move forward three steps. Finally, turn right to face a purple box.
