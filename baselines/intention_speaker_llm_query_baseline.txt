Below is a sequence of observations and corresponding actions taken by an AI agent in trying to execute a 'skill.' Observations should be interpreted as environment descriptions told to the agent. In this environment, names of skills are always succinct, specify object color when appropriate, and have underscores: for example, 'move_forward_2_steps', 'put_blue_key_on_floor', 'unlatch_green_door', or 'procure_brown_box'. Given this sequence below, what is the skill name that best describes the agent's trajectory? Do NOT say anything else except your chosen skill name!

Below is a sequence of observations and corresponding actions taken by an AI agent in trying to execute a 'skill.' Observations should be interpreted as environment descriptions told to the agent. In this environment, names of skills are always succinct, specify object color when appropriate, and have underscores: for example, 'move_forward_2_steps', 'put_blue_key_on_floor', 'unlatch_green_door', or 'procure_brown_box'. Given this sequence below, what is the skill name that best describes the agent's trajectory? Do NOT say anything else except your chosen skill name!

Below is a sequence of observations and corresponding actions taken by an AI agent in trying to execute a 'skill.' Observations should be interpreted as environment descriptions told to the agent. In this environment, names of skills are always succinct, specify object color when appropriate, and have underscores: for example, 'move_forward_2_steps', 'put_blue_key_on_floor', 'unlatch_green_door', or 'procure_brown_box'. Given this sequence below, what is the skill name that best describes the agent's trajectory? Do NOT say anything else except your chosen skill name!

Below is a sequence of observations and corresponding actions taken by an AI agent in trying to execute a 'skill.' Observations should be interpreted as environment descriptions told to the agent. In this environment, names of skills are always succinct, specify object color when appropriate, and have underscores: for example, 'move_forward_2_steps', 'put_blue_key_on_floor', 'unlatch_green_door', or 'procure_brown_box'. Given this sequence below, what is the skill name that best describes the agent's trajectory? Do NOT say anything else except your chosen skill name!

Below is a sequence of observations and corresponding actions taken by an AI agent in trying to execute a 'skill.' Observations should be interpreted as environment descriptions told to the agent. In this environment, names of skills are always succinct, specify object color when appropriate, and have underscores: for example, 'move_forward_2_steps', 'put_blue_key_on_floor', 'unlatch_green_door', or 'procure_brown_box'. Given this sequence below, what is the skill name that best describes the agent's trajectory? Do NOT say anything else except your chosen skill name!

In this environment, names of skills are always succinct, specify object color when appropriate, and have underscores: for example, 'move_forward_2_steps', 'put_blue_key_on_floor', 'unlatch_green_door', or 'procure_brown_box'. Given this sequence below, what is the skill name that best describes the agent's trajectory? Do NOT say anything else except your chosen skill name!
